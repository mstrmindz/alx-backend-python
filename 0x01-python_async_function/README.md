## Resources
Read or watch:
- [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
- [asyncio - Asynchronous I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- [random.uniform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform)

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following without the help of Google:
- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with asyncio
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create asyncio tasks
- How to use the random module

## Requirements
### General
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- Your code should follow the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x).
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All your modules should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`).
- All your functions should have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`).
- A documentation is not just a simple word; it's a complete sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length will be verified).
